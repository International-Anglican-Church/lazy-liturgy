Editing config.txt
------------------
The config.txt file contains information used by the Lazy Liturgy program.
If you want to change any of this info, you can open the file, edit it, and save it before running Lazy Liturgy.

How to find Document and Page IDs
---------------------------------
config.txt contains several IDs that reference Google Docs and Wordpress pages.
If you want to update these, you can find the ID of a Google Doc or Wordpress page by looking at the URL in the top bar of your browser.

If you open a Google Doc, the URL will be something like this: docs.google.com/document/d/1GClQeLe0R7T7HlK31Pf_Vr1BjTnvPVHrAP7WIVZvy0Q/edit
The ID is the thing starting with 1 between /document/d/ and /edit. In this case it's 1GClQeLe0R7T7HlK31Pf_Vr1BjTnvPVHrAP7WIVZvy0Q

If you open a Wordpress page, the URL will look something like this: www.springsiac.org/wp-admin/post.php?post=6586&action=edit
The ID is the number between post= and &action=edit. In this case it's 6586
